# Contra Interview Assessment

## Introduction

Welcome to the next step of Contra's engineering interview process! You'll be asked to complete a code assessment in the stack we use internally at Contra: Node.JS, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and PostgreSQL. We've configured sensible repository defaults so you can spend your time writing actual code, not configuration.

We know not everyone has experience with our core stack &mdash; that's okay! **The goal of this exercise is to assess your ability to learn, and make good software design decisions along the way.** To be respectful of your time, this assessment is designed to be completed in under _____ hours and has no deadlines or due dates.

If you have any questions, reach out to [Joseph](mailto:joseph@contra.com) -- he is very helpful ðŸ˜‰.

## Requirements

At Contra, feature flags enable our team to run experiments, ship to production frequently, and control the rollout of new features for our users. If you're not familiar with feature flags, [here's an article that explains the concept.](https://featureflags.io/feature-flags/).

Assume the following about feature flags:

- The same user cannot receive different values for the same feature flag
- Different users can be targeted with the same feature flag
- A feature flag can have boolean or [multivariate values](https://featureflags.io/multivariate-feature-flags/)

**Your task is to build a lightweight feature flag management service by completing the following backend and frontend tasks.**

- **Backend**
  - [ ] Build a GraphQL API that:
    - [ ] Exposes a GraphQL Mutation to target one or more users with a specific feature flag
    - [ ] Exposes a GraphQL Query that returns all users and their associated feature flags
    - [ ] Exposes a GraphQL Mutation to change the value of a feature flag for a specific user
- **Frontend**
  - [ ] Build a lightweight React dashboard that consumes your GraphQL API, providing a UI to:
    - [ ] Target one or more users with a specific feature flag
    - [ ] Change the value of a feature flag for a specific user
    - [ ] List the users in the system alongside their feature flags

_Note: To keep it simple, you don't need to build API functionality to create or delete feature flags or users. Assume that you can manually seed feature flags and users in the database, once you've designed the database schema to support._

## Evaluation

When evaluating your submission, we care about the following:

- [ ] Correctness
- [ ] Developer Experience
- [ ] Tests of any kind, as long as you can explain why you added the tests that you did
- [ ] Performance & Scaleability
- [ ] Code consistency, style, and quality

_There's no perfect solution &mdash; "Developer Experience, "Performance & Scaleability,", and "Code Quality" mean different things in different contexts. Use your best judgement, and explicitly call out any assumptions you made along the way. Remember: there aren't any tricks here, and we review every submission with the best intent._

## Submission

### Fork & PR

When you're ready, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). In your Pull Request, be sure to clearly explain the changes you made, and any assumptions your reviewer should keep in mind.

### Loom Submission

At Contra, we prize great communication over all else. In addition to great written communication, we love concise Loom demos that capture your personality and passion for your work, and convey what you can't in writing. As part of your submission, attach a <5 minute Loom to your PR description that introduces yourself, walks through your code, and the decisions you made along the way.

## Repository Setup Instructions

### Install NVM

The easiest way to install and manage versions Node.JS on your local machine is `nvm`.

[Follow the nvm installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Next, you'll want to install the version of Node this repository uses -- `v16.11`

```sh
$ nvm install 16.11
$ cd contra-interview-assessment
$ nvm use
```

If successful, you should get a message like this:

```sh
Now using node v16.11.0 (npm v7.11.2)
```

### Install Yarn

Next, you'll need to install the `yarn` package manager to install project dependencies and run scripts.

[Follow the yarn setup instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### Install Project Dependencies

For your convenience, this project is separated into `backend` and `frontend` sub-projects, each with their own dependencies. Now that `yarn` is installed locally, you'll want to `cd` into each each sub-project and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

```
$ cd backend
$ yarn
$ cd .. && cd frontend
$ yarn
```

###

### Start the Frontend

We've provided a fresh NextJS project out of the box. Once you've installed the correct NodeJS version with `nvm`, installed the `yarn` package manager, and run `yarn` in the `frontend` directory to install dependencies, you're all set to start coding.

To boot up the frontend, just run

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

and the application should come alive at `localhost:3000`

### Start the Backend

We've provided a fresh NodeJS/Fastify/TypeScript/GraphQL/PostgreSQL project out of the box.

The project expects a valid database connection string passed to the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable to start. We recommend using [Render](https://render.com), which provides a free hosted PostgreSQL instance in just a few clicks. [Have a look at the Render setup instructions](https://render.com/docs/databases#creating-a-database) for more detail. That said, you're welcome to use another database service of your choice, run a local PostgreSQL Docker container, etc. Regardless, once you've configured a database instance, set the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable:

```sh
$ export POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING='YOUR_PG_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING'
```

Once you've installed the correct NodeJS version with `nvm`, installed the `yarn` package manager, run `yarn` in the `backend` directory to install dependencies, and set the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable, you're all set to start coding.

To boot up the backend, just run

```sh
$ yarn dev
```

and the application should come alive at `localhost:8080/graphql`

This project comes with Apollo Explorer, a handy GUI to execute operations your GraphQL server. A `hello` query comes ready for you out of the box -- try it out:

```graphql
{
  hello
}
```

If successful, you'll get back the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "world"
  }
}
```

### A word on Databases, Slonik, and Migrations

We've provided the PostgreSQL client [`slonik`](https://github.com/gajus/slonik) out of the box for you to use, though you're welcome to replace it with any PostgreSQL client you'd like. The same goes for [`@slonik/migrator`](https://github.com/mmkal/slonik-tools/tree/master/packages/migrator) &mdash; it is there to help you with writing and managing database migrations, but feel free to use another tool if you see fit. Regardless of what technology you use, make sure to commit all migration artifacts with your submission, just as you would building for production.

If you chose to adopt something other than `slonik`, you'll want to update `createFastifyServer` to accept a database connection of your choosing, and include it in the GraphQL resolver context when instantiating `ApolloServer`.

If you choose to stay with `slonik` and `@slonik/migrator`, the following is relevant to you:

- An instance of `DatabasePoolType` is exposed to your GraphQL resolvers through the resolver context, like so:

```ts
import { QueryResolvers } from "../../../generated/types";
import { sql } from "slonik";

export const resolve: QueryResolvers["hello"] = async (
  _parent,
  _args,
  context
) => {
  const { pool } = context;
  const result = await pool.one<{ phrase: string }>(
    sql`SELECT 'world' as phrase;`
  );

  return result.phrase;
};
```

- All migration activity will run against the database instance you connected through the `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable. Make sure that `yarn migrate` prefixes all [commands](https://github.com/mmkal/slonik-tools/tree/master/packages/migrator#commands). Here's an example:

```sh
$ yarn migrate create --name user_account.sql
$ yarn migrate up
$ yarn migrate down
```

- A sample migration for a `user_account` table has provided for your convenience.
